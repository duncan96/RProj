This folder contains datasets and analysis performed on 2014-2015 Basketball player performances.  
The goal of this project was to define a ranking function for player performance that closely matched both datasets,
and could provide insights that might not be outwardly obvious.  While any one given feature could have been used for ranking,
this was about finding a more generalizable means for defining the productivity value of a player and testing some of the implications.
